# Claude Code & Spec-Kit Plus Integration

This file serves as a placeholder for integrating with external AI development tools like Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus in the monorepo structure.

## Purpose
- To define prompts, specifications, and instructions that can be used by AI assistants to understand and extend the project.
- To maintain a context for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency with the project's constitution.
- To provide guidance for AI assistants working with the monorepo structure.

## Monorepo Structure
This project follows a monorepo structure with the following key directories:
- `backend/` - Contains all backend services and APIs
- `frontend/` - Contains all frontend applications and UI components
- `specs/` - Contains all specifications, requirements, and design documents
- `.spec-kit/` - Contains configuration for the spec-kit tooling

## Usage
When interacting with an AI, reference this file and the `CONSTITUTION.md` to provide the necessary context for generating code, documentation, or tests. The AI should be aware of the monorepo structure and place new components in the appropriate directories.
