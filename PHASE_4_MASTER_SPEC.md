# Phase 4 Master Specification: Local Kubernetes Deployment

## Core Objective
Transition the Phase 3 AI Chatbot to a Cloud-Native architecture using Minikube and Helm. Follow Spec-Driven Development strictly (No manual coding).

## Technology Stack
- Containerization: Docker (Multi-stage builds)
- Orchestration: Kubernetes (Minikube)
- Package Management: Helm Charts
- AIOps Tools: Gordon, kubectl-ai, kagent
- Backend: FastAPI, SQLModel, MCP SDK, Neon DB
- Frontend: Next.js, OpenAI ChatKit

## Deployment Requirements
1. Use 'eval $(minikube docker-env)' for local image building.
2. Frontend must expose port 3000.
3. Backend must expose port 8000.
4. Secrets (DATABASE_URL, API Keys) must be managed via K8s Secrets.
5. Implementation must be generated by Claude Code based on specs in /specs/deployment/.

## Success Criteria
- Pods are 'Running' on Minikube.
- Chatbot is accessible via 'minikube service'.
- Persistence works with Neon DB from within the cluster.
