# Specification Quality Checklist: Task Web App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-02
**Feature**: [specs/1-task-web-app/spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) in user scenarios
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specs are clear. Although the user requested technical constraints in the prompt, they were placed in the "Requirements" or "API Specification" separate file while keeping the core `spec.md` mostly business-focused (as per general guidelines).
- No major clarifications needed as the request was fairly standard for a Task App.
